The file describes the variables, the data and work performed to clean up the data.
This code book is related to the tidy.txt file located on this repository.
For context information, refer to README.md file of this repository.
Data structure (variable and observations) is described on the Data section.
All the work used to transform the data is described on Work section.

#Data
	On the final tidy.txt, each variable is separated by space. There are 81 of them: 79 for measurement and 2 for subject and activity. Each row (180 in total) contains the average of 10299 initial observations/measurements for the mean and standard deviation variables. 

		Variables
			Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

				1.	ID
					Subject: integer varying from 1 to 30
					Activity: character string
					WALKING: subject was walking
					WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
					WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
